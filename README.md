# DiscordColorways (by [Project Colorway](https://github.com/DaBluLite/ProjectColorway))

## Before you read further below, let's address the main question: *What is a colorway?*
Colorways are simple color schemes/themes for Discord, meant to expand the functionality of the built in light and dark themes, by offering more simple color choices, that aren't locked behind Nitro.

### The Definitive way of styling Discord and select themes

* [Download the BetterDiscord plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaBluLite/DiscordColorways/master/DiscordColorways.plugin.js)
* [Download the Vencord userplugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DaBluLite/DiscordColorways/master/VencordUserPlugin/discordColorways)
* Use the available `@import` lines for the different Colorways

### Currently Supported themes:
* Discord Default
* [Virtual Boy](https://github.com/Riddim-GLiTCH/Virtual-Boy), by [Riddim GLiTCH](https://github.com/Riddim-GLiTCH) (Works both as-is and with a preset for extra accuracy (Virtual Boy))
* [Modular](https://github.com/SEELE1306/Modular), by [SEELE1306](https://github.com/SEELE1306) (Available only as a preset (Modular))

* [Nexus Remastered](https://github.com/DaBluLite/NexusRemastered) (Available only as a preset (Nexus Remastered))
* You tell me, this list can still grow with your help. If you know any compatible themes, open an Issue with the name of the supported theme.
