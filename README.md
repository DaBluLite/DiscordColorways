# Discord Colorways

## Before you read further below, let's address the main question: *What is a colorway?*
Colorways are simple color only themes for Discord, meant to expand the functionality of the built in light and dark themes, by offering more simple color choices, that aren't locked behind Nitro.

### The Definitive way of styling Discord and select themes

* [On a browser? Install the UserScript](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/477400-discordcolorways/code/DiscordColorways.user.js)
* [Download the DiscordColorways Vencord userplugin](https://github.com/DaBluLite/DiscordColorways/tree/master/Vencord-Userplugin)
* [Download The DiscordColorways BetterDiscord plugin](https://github.com/DaBluLite/DiscordColorways/raw/master/DiscordColorways.plugin.js) (Credits to Strencher, since the source of the plugin is based on his PlatformIndicators plugin)
* Use the available `@import` lines for the different Colorways

### Currently Supported themes:
* Discord Default
* [MobileV2](https://github.com/DaBluLite/MobileV2)
* [Segmentation:Blurple](https://github.com/DaBluLite/SegmentationBlurple)
* [Virtual Boy, by Riddim GLiTCH](https://github.com/Riddim-GLiTCH/Virtual-Boy) (Also available as a Preset)
* Modular, by [aoithesceneryhoarder](https://github.com/SEELE1306) (Available as a Preset)
* [Cyan](https://github.com/DaBluLite/Cyan) (Select the Cyan Preset in the Creator, otherwise requires the CyanColorways addon, available in Cyan's GitHub and Cyan+)
* You tell me, this list can still grow with your help. If you know any compatible themes, open an Issue with the name of the supported theme.
