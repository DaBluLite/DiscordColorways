# Discord Colorways

## Before you read further below, let's address the main question: *What is a colorway?*
Colorways are simple color schemes/themes for Discord, meant to expand the functionality of the built in light and dark themes, by offering more simple color choices, that aren't locked behind Nitro.

### The Definitive way of styling Discord and select themes

* ~~On a browser? Install the UserScript~~ This is very broken in its current state, same with the BD version
* Use the available `@import` lines for the different Colorways

### Currently Supported themes:
* Discord Default
* [MobileV2](https://github.com/DaBluLite/MobileV2)
* [Segmentation:Blurple](https://github.com/DaBluLite/SegmentationBlurple)
* [Virtual Boy, by Riddim GLiTCH](https://github.com/Riddim-GLiTCH/Virtual-Boy) (Also available as a Preset)
* Modular, by [aoithesceneryhoarder](https://github.com/SEELE1306) (Available as a Preset)
* [Cyan](https://github.com/DaBluLite/Cyan) (Select the Cyan Preset in the Creator, otherwise requires the CyanColorways addon, available in Cyan's GitHub and Cyan+)
* You tell me, this list can still grow with your help. If you know any compatible themes, open an Issue with the name of the supported theme.
